# API Tester

## Description
I made this small project in order to have a tool that tests API's with different kind of request methods.

I got the idea from a project I was working on, where I had to test a lot of API's and I had to do it manually. So I thought it would be a good idea to automate this process.

No libraries used, only HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript.

## How to use
1. Clone the repository
2. Open the html file in your browser
3. Test your API
4. Enjoy, feel free to contribute and give suggestions !

## Features
### Version 0.1.1 :
- GET, POST requests
- Request history
- Send custom request body as JSON for POST requests such as 
    ```json 
    {"name": "Luke Skywalker"}
    ```
